A tale of bridges
=================

A bit of open source magic happened today.  Actually, it has been
happening a while, the full story goes back decades.  Or rather to the
time when humans first started communicating with each other.  But I
*digress* (note to self, find a good way to link to post's I haven't
written yet).

A few weeks ago I came across this blog posting `Programming
Sucks<http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks>`_

The thesis of one section was that, "All programming teams are
constructed by and of crazy people"

::
  Imagine joining an engineering team. You're excited and full of ideas,
  probably just out of school and a world of clean, beautiful designs,
  awe-inspiring in their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy, and
  strength. You start by meeting Mary, project leader for a bridge in a
  major metropolitan area. Mary introduces you to Fred, after you get
  through the fifteen security checks installed by Dave because Dave had
  his sweater stolen off his desk once and Never Again. Fred only works
  with wood, so you ask why he's involved because this bridge is
  supposed to allow rush-hour traffic full of cars full of mortal humans
  to cross a 200-foot drop over rapids. Don't worry, says Mary, Fred's
  going to handle the walkways. What walkways? Well Fred made a good
  case for walkways and they're going to add to the bridge's appeal. Of
  course, they'll have to be built without railings, because there's a
  strict no railings rule enforced by Phil, who's not an
  engineer. Nobody's sure what Phil does, but it's definitely full of
  synergy and has to do with upper management, whom none of the
  engineers want to deal with so they just let Phil do what he
  wants. Sara, meanwhile, has found several hemorrhaging-edge paving
  techniques, and worked them all into the bridge design, so you'll have
  to build around each one as the bridge progresses, since each one
  means different underlying support and safety concerns. Tom and Harry
  have been working together for years, but have an ongoing feud over
  whether to use metric or imperial measurements, and it's become a case
  of "whoever got to that part of the design first." This has been such
  a headache for the people actually screwing things together, they've
  given up and just forced, hammered, or welded their way through the
  day with whatever parts were handy. Also, the bridge was designed as a
  suspension bridge, but nobody actually knew how to build a suspension
  bridge, so they got halfway through it and then just added extra
  support columns to keep the thing standing, but they left the
  suspension cables because they're still sort of holding up parts of
  the bridge. Nobody knows which parts, but everybody's pretty sure
  they're important parts. After the introductions are made, you are
  invited to come up with some new ideas, but you don't have any because
  you're a propulsion engineer and don't know anything about bridges.

  Would you drive across this bridge? No. If it somehow got built,
  everybody involved would be executed. Yet some version of this dynamic
  wrote every single program you have ever used, banking software,
  websites, and a ubiquitously used program that was supposed to protect
  information on the internet but didn't.

Now, this sparked an idea in my mind and I had a friend, Leona, who
likes to draw stuff.  So I sent her the story about the bridge. As I
wrote to Leona::

  I am wanting to give a talk which will feature this bridge thing
  (read below) and was wondering if you would be able to draw that
  bridge for me?

  Think Heath Robinson with maybe a touch of Salvador Dali.

At this point I am **way** beyond my artistic knowledge and out of my
depth, but I keep going::

  wooden sidewalks, no railings, suspension cables in weird places,
  crazy ceramic tiles everywhere (all different designs).  Dave's
  missing sweater holding up part of the bridge etc etc.

  Not sure if this is the sort of thing you usually draw, but thought
  it might be something you could do.

Oh, and also if you want to read the whole bridge article it is `here<>http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks>`_,
on the aptly named `stilldrinking.org<http://stilldrinking.org>`_

It explains why I am a little crazy (ok maybe only partly).

So we exchanged a few emails about the details of the picture, oh and
I threw in wanting a picture of a perfect bridge as well, one you
might actually want to walk across.

I added that I wanted to write a story here, on this blog, which is
itself a bit of a work in progress, so I added a *nerd aside* for Leona::

  (nerd aside: I need to do some nerd magic to turn that into a proper
  blog -- I might even have that done later today -- but remember this
  is software and it could end up like that bridge).

Well the blog still needs work, but at least it hasn't got people
depending on it to get them across a gorge.

Well today I got the pictures back from Leona.   And that has led to a
whole other part of the *tale of bridges*.   Will try to write that
soon.
