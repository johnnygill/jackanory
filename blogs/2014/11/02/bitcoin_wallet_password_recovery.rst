Bitcoin wallet password recovery
================================

A few weeks back I was in Ottawa and I bought some bitcoins from this
bitcoin ATM:

I made a basic newbie mistake and took the one piece of paper with the
wallet password on it to Ottawa with me.

I since put it somewhere safe.  Very safe.  So very safe that even I
have no idea where I put it.

This reminds me of my mum.  She was an expert at finding good
hiding places about the house.  Very good hiding places.  So good, she
would forget where things were.   My sister and I got quite used to
getting late Christmas presents, maybe as late as Easter when mum
would happen across one of her stashes.

Basically, it was like geo-caching, but low tech and way better hiding
places. 

So, after wasting way too much time trying to find the thing I came
across `walletrecoveryservices.com
<http://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/>`_ 

I sent off an email with brief details of the problem and some good
clues as to the password.  I got a response in two minutes.

Now just hoping my password is as insecure as I think it is.
