<p>A few weeks back I was in Ottawa and I bought some bitcoins from this
bitcoin ATM:</p>

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
<p>I made a basic newbie mistake and took the one piece of paper with the
wallet password on it to Ottawa with me.</p>
<p>I since put it somewhere safe.  Very safe.  So very safe that even I
have no idea where I put it.</p>
<p>This reminds me of my mum.  She was an expert at finding good
hiding places about the house.  Very good hiding places.  So good, she
would forget where things were.   My sister and I got quite used to
getting late Christmas presents, maybe as late as Easter when mum
would happen across one of her stashes.</p>
<p>Basically, it was like geo-caching, but low tech and way better hiding
places.</p>
<p>So, after wasting way too much time trying to find the thing I came
across <a class="reference external" href="http://www.walletrecoveryservices.com">walletrecoveryservices.com</a></p>
<p>I sent off an email with brief details of the problem and some good
clues as to the password.  I got a response in two minutes.</p>
<p>Now just hoping my password is as insecure as I think it is.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Art Builds on Art</h1>
<p>A couple of days back I got the bridge drawings from Leona.</p>
<p>A friend, Damon, was over at our house that evening.  Leona had
visited us and he had met her then, so I wanted to show him the
drawings.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to explain what they were about.  I told him the tale
of the engineer and the bridge, I talked about crazy software teams
and why they arise and about open source and how that works.</p>
<p>We were using an old laptop, running Ubuntu.  He asked if we could
write something like <em>photoshop</em> on this thing.  I said, we could, but
someone has beaten us to it, I told him about the GIMP.</p>
<p>So we fired up the GIMP and I opened Leona’s drawing in it.</p>
<p>Now a little digression on the GIMP is in order.  I have used the GIMP
many times, not frequently, but the GIMP must have been around 17
years or more.  I can’t remember a time with Linux, but without the
GIMP.</p>
<p>But, I have never been able to do anything with it without
considerable cursing.  At 25c a curse I could have bought <em>photoshop</em>
many times.  Instead, I muddled by with the GIMP until whoever had
asked me to do some magic with it lost interest.</p>
<p>So while I was desperately trying to remember how this thing works, I
told Damon about the GIMP Tool Kit, or GTK.</p>
<p>I explained how when the guys started to write it the first thing they
decided to build was a GUI Toolkit, but they called it the GIMP Tool
Kit.</p>
<p>This eventually became to be known as GTK and was used in a plethora
of projects, usually beginning with ‘g’.  But that is a whole other
story.</p>
<p>So, by now Damon had taken over the computer and was exploring the
GIMP.  We needed food, so I started getting that ready.  Ten minutes
later I glanced at the screen.</p>
<p>Damon had done more in ten minutes with the GIMP than I had in 17
years.</p>
<p>So we stopped to eat and talk.  He says, “so that thing is free?”.  I
explain, yes its been around for years, but its not just free, they
give you the whole manual and everything you need to build it.  So if
we need to change it, if something doesn’t seem to work, we can
try and fix it.</p>
<p>So he asks again, “so that thing is free?”.  And he tells me how he
has used <em>photoshop</em> a lot over the years and never knew there was a
free option.  He confessed, that the software he used, or rather the
activation key, might not have come from the usual source.  He felt
bad about that, and mad that he’d never heard of the GIMP.</p>
<p>I was just relieved.  Before he tried it I was expecting frustration
with the tool, that it didn’t work as he would expect, that things
were not quite right.  It is why I made a pathetic attempt to show him
what it could do before I let him near it.  I’d always heard the GIMP
is ok, but you really need <em>photoshop</em>.</p>
<p>So here was Damon, editing a photo Leona had given us, that was
inspired by a story on <a class="reference external" href="stilldrinking.org">stilldrinking.org</a></p>
<p>And now all of this has lead to more stories here.</p>
<p>This is what happens when ideas are shared.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A tale of two bridges</h1>
<p>I was looking forward to opening the email and seeing the drawings.</p>
<p>They were line drawings, comic style.  Here is the first drawing:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="http://johnnygill.github.io/jackanory/blogs/blog/html/2014/06/11/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge1.png"><img alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge1.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge1.png" style="width: 562px; height: 410px;"/></a>
<p>You can see Dave’s sweater slowly unravelling and being used to hold
the whole shakey structure together.</p>
<p>The deck of the bridge represents the software platform, or rather,
platforms, as each section of the bridge seems to have a different
design.</p>
<p>The monitor is displaying an error message, which bleeds into the
ravine (the ANY key is a tongue-in-cheek reference, which is placed
high in the sky so as to be an unattainable solution);</p>
<p>The <em>city</em> represents frustrated, dismayed and angry users, on the
edge of the ravine, all they want is a simple bridge to lead them
across.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-software-invariably-ends-up-looking-like-this-bridge">
<h2>Why software invariably ends up looking like this bridge</h2>
<p>Building great software is hard.  Ironically, building mediocre
software is probably harder.  As with the bridge builders things are
often made difficult for the engineers.  They have many arbitary and
unhelpful constraints from their own management, most of whom have
forgotten why these rules were introduced in the first place and none
of whom have ever used the tools that the engineers are using.</p>
<p>They are invariably dealing with many different systems, built with
different technologies.  Often these are proprietary systems which come
without the actual source code.  So, if a system does not quite work
as it is supposed to they just have to work around it.</p>
<p>If they are lucky the system comes with support and there is someone
at the end of a phone line who has never actually written any code,
but who has a script to follow.  And if you stick with them for the
next 2.5 hours might get you to the point where they say, “Well we
haven’t seen that error before”.</p>
<p>They file a bug and for the next two releases you eagerly install the
new version only to find your bug hasn’t been fixed.</p>
<p>By the third release you have found a cunning way to actually take
advantage of the bug to do some neat stuff you couldn’t do if the code
actually worked as intended.  So you build a whole new analysis system
around that bug, only to discover they fixed it in the fourth release.</p>
<p>Every member of the team is an expert on one system or another, one
language or another.   It has taken them years to get to this level of
comfort with their tool of choice.  They remember the pain of getting
there, they fear the day they have to switch to something new, go
through all that pain again.  They strongly believe that the tools
they use are the very best (after the pain they have gone through to
master it all, they had better be).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="so-is-there-a-way-to-build-software-teams-that-actually-works">
<h2>So is there a way to build software teams that actually works?</h2>
<p>It turns out, there is.  People have been doing it for decades now.
It is called <em>open source</em>.  Although, I think I prefer <em>open
literature</em>.</p>
<p>But first, the tale continues.</p>
<p>The residents of the city were angry, but things got worse when the
company they had paid to build the bridge went bust.  Something to do
with a lawsuit due to one of their previous projects and some people
that died using it.</p>
<p>Someone called Richard had a workshop in which he built tools.  Many
people in the city thought he was a little crazy.  He had a huge beard
and didn’t get out much.   But he built great tools.  He also wrote
instruction manuals telling you how to build those tools.</p>
<p>He would gladly give you the tools he built, but insisted on giving
you a copy of his instruction manual too.  He was delighted if you
used it to build more tools and was also happy if you sold them or
gave them to others.  But he insisted that you also give them a copy
of the instruction manual.</p>
<p>He loved it when you found new ways to build tools and updated your
copy of the instruction manual.  But, he insisted that if you gave
anyone one of the tools you had built that you give them the full
instruction manual telling them how to build the tool.  So they could
build new tools, just like Richard let you do.</p>
<p>Well along came Linus.  He used to build wooden components.  He used
Richard’s tools and like Richard, gave away his components, along with
the instruction manuals he had used to make them.</p>
<p>Beowulf came along and used Linus’s manual to teach himself how to
link together these wooden components and make some really beautiful
structures.</p>
<p>Larry started building tools that helped you do wonderful things with
string.  Larry’s tools let you take strings and weave them into ropes
and baskets, nets and a whole wonderous world of things.</p>
<p>But, strings are delicate things and after a while threads would start
to come unravelled.  People who built stuff with Larry’s string tools
also passed on their instruction manuals, but these manuals were
really hard to read.  Even the person who wrote them would struggle to
follow the manual a year or so after it was written.</p>
<p>By now there were little cottage industries everywhere, writing tools
to work with string.  Guido came along and read the instruction books
for all these tools and used these books to help him build his own
string building tool.</p>
<p>His manual was easy to read and when you used it to build new tools to
do things with strings the manuals for those tools were really easy to
follow.  Guido also introduced a thing he called the <em>GIL</em>.  Nobody
really understood this thing, but Guido insisted it was really
important and would help stop threads unravelling.</p>
<p>Well by now, many of the people of the city were working with all
these tools and doing some wonderful things.</p>
<p>Managing all these instruction manuals was becoming a bit of a
challenge.  There were thousands of manuals and each manual came in
lots of versions.</p>
<p>Libraries sprung up to hold the manuals.  The libraries all had
strange names like <em>sccs</em>, <em>rcs</em>, <em>cvs</em> and <em>svn</em>.  The neat thing was
the libraries came with instruction manuals that helped you use them.</p>
<p>Linus grew frustrated with these libraries, as did others and they
came up with a new type of library that made it easy for anyone to
take a copy of the whole library and create a new library.</p>
<p>Linus created a library called <em>git</em>.  Others created <em>bazaar</em> and
<em>mercurial</em>.  Life was good.</p>
<p>But, few people could understand how <em>git</em> worked.  Some read the
manual Linus had written and managed to figure it all out.  They made
changes to the manual, made it easier to read and created new types of
<em>git</em> library that mere mortals could also use.  And they taught each
other how to use the library.</p>
<p>Well by now the people of the city were hard at work on the bridge.
And bit by bit, using all these tools, they transformed it into this
beautiful, simple structure:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="http://johnnygill.github.io/jackanory/blogs/blog/html/2014/06/11/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge2.png"><img alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge2.png" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnnygill/jackanory/master/art/leona/bridge2.png" style="width: 410px; height: 562px;"/></a>
<p>Jacob came along on his pony and rode across the bridge to the
beautiful oasis on the other side.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>A tale of bridges</h1>
<p>A bit of open source magic happened today.  Actually, it has been
happening a while, the full story goes back decades.  Or rather to the
time when humans first started communicating with each other.  But I
<em>digress</em> (note to self, find a good way to link to post’s I haven’t
written yet).</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I came across this blog posting
<a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">Programming Sucks</a></p>
<p>The thesis of one section was that, <strong>All programming teams are
constructed by and of crazy people</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Imagine joining an engineering team. You’re excited
and full of ideas, probably just out of school and a
world of clean, beautiful designs, awe-inspiring in
their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy, and
strength. You start by meeting Mary, project leader
for a bridge in a major metropolitan area. Mary
introduces you to Fred, after you get through the
fifteen security checks installed by Dave because
Dave had his sweater stolen off his desk once and
Never Again. Fred only works with wood, so you ask
why he’s involved because this bridge is supposed to
allow rush-hour traffic full of cars full of mortal
humans to cross a 200-foot drop over rapids. Don’t
worry, says Mary, Fred’s going to handle the
walkways. What walkways? Well Fred made a good case
for walkways and they’re going to add to the bridge’s
appeal. Of course, they’ll have to be built without
railings, because there’s a strict no railings rule
enforced by Phil, who’s not an engineer. Nobody’s
sure what Phil does, but it’s definitely full of
synergy and has to do with upper management, whom
none of the engineers want to deal with so they just
let Phil do what he wants. Sara, meanwhile, has found
several hemorrhaging-edge paving techniques, and
worked them all into the bridge design, so you’ll
have to build around each one as the bridge
progresses, since each one means different underlying
support and safety concerns. Tom and Harry have been
working together for years, but have an ongoing feud
over whether to use metric or imperial measurements,
and it’s become a case of “whoever got to that part
of the design first.” This has been such a headache
for the people actually screwing things together,
they’ve given up and just forced, hammered, or welded
their way through the day with whatever parts were
handy. Also, the bridge was designed as a suspension
bridge, but nobody actually knew how to build a
suspension bridge, so they got halfway through it and
then just added extra support columns to keep the
thing standing, but they left the suspension cables
because they’re still sort of holding up parts of the
bridge. Nobody knows which parts, but everybody’s
pretty sure they’re important parts. After the
introductions are made, you are invited to come up
with some new ideas, but you don’t have any because
you’re a propulsion engineer and don’t know anything
about bridges.</p>
<p>Would you drive across this bridge? No. If it somehow
got built, everybody involved would be executed. Yet
some version of this dynamic wrote every single
program you have ever used, banking software,
websites, and a ubiquitously used program that was
supposed to protect information on the internet but
didn’t.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, this sparked an idea in my mind and I had a friend, Leona, who
likes to draw stuff.  So I sent her the story about the bridge. As I
wrote to Leona:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I am wanting to give a talk which will feature this
bridge thing (read below) and was wondering if you
would be able to draw that bridge for me?</p>
<p>Think Heath Robinson with maybe a touch of Salvador
Dali.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At this point I am <strong>way</strong> beyond my artistic knowledge and out of my
depth, but I keep going:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>wooden sidewalks, no railings, suspension cables in
weird places, crazy ceramic tiles everywhere (all
different designs).  Dave’s missing sweater holding
up part of the bridge etc etc.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the sort of thing you usually
draw, but thought it might be something you could do.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I added:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Oh, and also if you want to read the whole bridge article it is
<a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">here</a>,
on the aptly named <a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org">stilldrinking.org</a></p>
<p>It explains why I am a little crazy (ok maybe only partly).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So we exchanged a few emails about the details of the picture, oh and
I threw in wanting a picture of a perfect bridge as well, one you
might actually want to walk across.</p>
<p>I said that I wanted to write a story here, on this blog, which is
itself a bit of a work in progress, so I included a <em>nerd aside</em> for Leona:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(nerd aside: I need to do some nerd magic to turn
that into a proper blog – I might even have that
done later today – but remember this is software and
it could end up like that bridge).</div></blockquote>
<p>Well the blog still needs work, but at least it hasn’t got people
depending on it to get them across a gorge.</p>
<p>Well today I got the pictures back from Leona.   And that has led to a
whole other part of the <em>tale of bridges</em>.   Will try to write that
soon.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Letter to Gazette</h1>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We were struck by your opinion piece on Saturday.  This paragraph, near the
start of the article, intrigued us:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>The young people now coming of are the first in almost a century to
embark life in a Bermuda where their choices are narrowing, not
expanding.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We understand where this perception comes from, but feel that this
does not have to be the case in Bermuda.</p>
<p>The world is changing rapidly, a key driving force of this change is
the internet.  This can be good for Bermuda.</p>
<p>The article went on to say:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Further education and the chance to broaden cultural horizons beyond
our shores is now a financial impossibility for far too many gifted
youngsters.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Young people today are faced with many opportunities to learn through
the internet.  There are amazing resources out there.  People can find
others that share their interests wherever they may live.  There are
others out there happy to be your mentors, to help you learn, to let
you help them learn too.</p>
<p>The article makes some excellent observations about schools.  There
are some skilled and dedicated people in our schools, often working
with poor resources.  The world is changing faster than curriculae can
hope to change.  Schools and colleges cannot do it alone.</p>
<p>We see Bermudans helping each other and others daily.  It is central
to way many people live here.</p>
<p>Bermuda also has many very talented and dedicated people, more
than you would expect of any town of its size.  There are people with
time and resources to help others, yet it is often those with least
that help most.</p>
<p>Bermuda has a complicated history.  None of us can change that.  What
we can do is work together to turn this into the best place in the
world to live, for <em>everyone</em> that lives here.</p>
<p>On July 18th Nelson Mandela would have been been 96.  He was heavily
guided in his later life by a concept called “ubuntu”.  It is a South
African word that does not translate well into English.  In Nelson
Mandela’s words:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Ubuntu does not mean that people should not enrich themselves. The
question therefore is: Are you going to do so in order to enable the
community around you to be able to improve?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On July 18th, why not find someone who needs your help and offer it?
Best of all, help someone learn, let someone teach you something.</p>
<p>Johnny and Mary</p>
<p>PS no need to wait until July 18th</p>
<p>PPS Johnny remembers the Firkin Wine bar at college being renamed the
Mandela Bar.  You have no idea the fuss that debate caused.  It was
1981, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>It is now caled The Graduate.  Times change.</p>
<p>PPPS</p>
<p>Ubuntu <a class="reference external" href="http://www.relandothompkins.com/philosophy">philosophy.</a></p>
