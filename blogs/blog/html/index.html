        <h1><a href="2014/06/09/a_tale_of_bridges.html">A tale of bridges</a></h1>
<p>A bit of open source magic happened today.  Actually, it has been
happening a while, the full story goes back decades.  Or rather to the
time when humans first started communicating with each other.  But I
<em>digress</em> (note to self, find a good way to link to post’s I haven’t
written yet).</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I came across this blog posting
<a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">Programming Sucks</a></p>
<p>The thesis of one section was that, <strong>All programming teams are
constructed by and of crazy people</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Imagine joining an engineering team. You’re excited
and full of ideas, probably just out of school and a
world of clean, beautiful designs, awe-inspiring in
their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy, and
strength. You start by meeting Mary, project leader
for a bridge in a major metropolitan area. Mary
introduces you to Fred, after you get through the
fifteen security checks installed by Dave because
Dave had his sweater stolen off his desk once and
Never Again. Fred only works with wood, so you ask
why he’s involved because this bridge is supposed to
allow rush-hour traffic full of cars full of mortal
humans to cross a 200-foot drop over rapids. Don’t
worry, says Mary, Fred’s going to handle the
walkways. What walkways? Well Fred made a good case
for walkways and they’re going to add to the bridge’s
appeal. Of course, they’ll have to be built without
railings, because there’s a strict no railings rule
enforced by Phil, who’s not an engineer. Nobody’s
sure what Phil does, but it’s definitely full of
synergy and has to do with upper management, whom
none of the engineers want to deal with so they just
let Phil do what he wants. Sara, meanwhile, has found
several hemorrhaging-edge paving techniques, and
worked them all into the bridge design, so you’ll
have to build around each one as the bridge
progresses, since each one means different underlying
support and safety concerns. Tom and Harry have been
working together for years, but have an ongoing feud
over whether to use metric or imperial measurements,
and it’s become a case of “whoever got to that part
of the design first.” This has been such a headache
for the people actually screwing things together,
they’ve given up and just forced, hammered, or welded
their way through the day with whatever parts were
handy. Also, the bridge was designed as a suspension
bridge, but nobody actually knew how to build a
suspension bridge, so they got halfway through it and
then just added extra support columns to keep the
thing standing, but they left the suspension cables
because they’re still sort of holding up parts of the
bridge. Nobody knows which parts, but everybody’s
pretty sure they’re important parts. After the
introductions are made, you are invited to come up
with some new ideas, but you don’t have any because
you’re a propulsion engineer and don’t know anything
about bridges.</p>
<p>Would you drive across this bridge? No. If it somehow
got built, everybody involved would be executed. Yet
some version of this dynamic wrote every single
program you have ever used, banking software,
websites, and a ubiquitously used program that was
supposed to protect information on the internet but
didn’t.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, this sparked an idea in my mind and I had a friend, Leona, who
likes to draw stuff.  So I sent her the story about the bridge. As I
wrote to Leona:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I am wanting to give a talk which will feature this
bridge thing (read below) and was wondering if you
would be able to draw that bridge for me?</p>
<p>Think Heath Robinson with maybe a touch of Salvador
Dali.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At this point I am <strong>way</strong> beyond my artistic knowledge and out of my
depth, but I keep going:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>wooden sidewalks, no railings, suspension cables in
weird places, crazy ceramic tiles everywhere (all
different designs).  Dave’s missing sweater holding
up part of the bridge etc etc.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is the sort of thing you usually
draw, but thought it might be something you could do.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I added:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Oh, and also if you want to read the whole bridge article it is
<a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">here</a>,
on the aptly named <a class="reference external" href="http://stilldrinking.org">stilldrinking.org</a></p>
<p>It explains why I am a little crazy (ok maybe only partly).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So we exchanged a few emails about the details of the picture, oh and
I threw in wanting a picture of a perfect bridge as well, one you
might actually want to walk across.</p>
<p>I said that I wanted to write a story here, on this blog, which is
itself a bit of a work in progress, so I included a <em>nerd aside</em> for Leona:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(nerd aside: I need to do some nerd magic to turn
that into a proper blog – I might even have that
done later today – but remember this is software and
it could end up like that bridge).</div></blockquote>
<p>Well the blog still needs work, but at least it hasn’t got people
depending on it to get them across a gorge.</p>
<p>Well today I got the pictures back from Leona.   And that has led to a
whole other part of the <em>tale of bridges</em>.   Will try to write that
soon.</p>

        <h1><a href="2014/05/11/letter_to_gazette.html">Letter to Gazette</a></h1>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We were struck by your opinion piece on Saturday.  This paragraph, near the
start of the article, intrigued us:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>The young people now coming of are the first in almost a century to
embark life in a Bermuda where their choices are narrowing, not
expanding.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We understand where this perception comes from, but feel that this
does not have to be the case in Bermuda.</p>
<p>The world is changing rapidly, a key driving force of this change is
the internet.  This can be good for Bermuda.</p>
<p>The article went on to say:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Further education and the chance to broaden cultural horizons beyond
our shores is now a financial impossibility for far too many gifted
youngsters.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Young people today are faced with many opportunities to learn through
the internet.  There are amazing resources out there.  People can find
others that share their interests wherever they may live.  There are
others out there happy to be your mentors, to help you learn, to let
you help them learn too.</p>
<p>The article makes some excellent observations about schools.  There
are some skilled and dedicated people in our schools, often working
with poor resources.  The world is changing faster than curriculae can
hope to change.  Schools and colleges cannot do it alone.</p>
<p>We see Bermudans helping each other and others daily.  It is central
to way many people live here.</p>
<p>Bermuda also has many very talented and dedicated people, more
than you would expect of any town of its size.  There are people with
time and resources to help others, yet it is often those with least
that help most.</p>
<p>Bermuda has a complicated history.  None of us can change that.  What
we can do is work together to turn this into the best place in the
world to live, for <em>everyone</em> that lives here.</p>
<p>On July 18th Nelson Mandela would have been been 96.  He was heavily
guided in his later life by a concept called “ubuntu”.  It is a South
African word that does not translate well into English.  In Nelson
Mandela’s words:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>Ubuntu does not mean that people should not enrich themselves. The
question therefore is: Are you going to do so in order to enable the
community around you to be able to improve?
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On July 18th, why not find someone who needs your help and offer it?
Best of all, help someone learn, let someone teach you something.</p>
<p>Johnny and Mary</p>
<p>PS no need to wait until July 18th</p>
<p>PPS Johnny remembers the Firkin Wine bar at college being renamed the
Mandela Bar.  You have no idea the fuss that debate caused.  It was
1981, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>It is now caled The Graduate.  Times change.</p>
<p>PPPS</p>
